"The Laws of Form" by G. Spencer-Brown.


In Python, let "a form" be any data-structure composed entirely of tuples.

We shall consider the absence of any form to be "the ground" and have the
Boolean value of True.

A "mark" is the empty tuple or any tuple without a mark; marks have the
Boolean value of False.

'''

#: The lambda function "mark" reduces any form and returns its Boolean value.
#:
mark = lambda form: not form or not any(imap(mark, form))


#  Reduce a form according to these rules:
#
#    (()) -> nothing    "Cancel"
#    ()() -> ()      un-"Repeat"
#


#: Let a be a Value-Preserving function that removes (()) from forms.
#:
#: This corresponds to applying "Cancel" to all possible inner forms in a
#: form.
#:
a = lambda form: tuple(inner for inner in form if inner != ((),))

#: Let b be a Value-Preserving function that removes all copies of () in
#: a form.
#:
#: This corresponds to applying un-"Repeat" to all possible inner forms
#: in a form.
#:
b = lambda form: form if () not in form else ((),) + tuple(ifilter(None, form))


#: We can define the Value-Preserving function R in terms of recursive
#: application of the a and b reduction functions, which correspond to
#: "Cancel" and un-"Repeat" applied exhaustively.
#:
#: bool(R(form)) == not mark(form) for all forms.
#:
R = lambda form: tuple(a(b(tuple(map(R, form)))))






#  Produce new forms by applying these rules:
#
#    nothing -> (())
#         () -> ()()
#

z = lambda form: (((),),) + tuple(form)

y = lambda form: ((),) + form if () in form else form

P = lambda form: tuple(y(z(P(inner) for inner in form)))


# Generate random new forms.
from random import random

T = lambda form: z(form) if random() > 0.5 else y(form)
I = lambda: () if random() > 0.5 else ((),)

def wrap(form, i):
  '''

  * -> ((*))

  In order to handle the wrapping of nothing in-between the inner forms
  of the form we adopt the convention that even i (0, 2, 4, ...) will
  select the intersticies of the inner forms, while the odd i (1, 3, ...)
  will select the inner forms themselves.

  Therefore the valid indicies for a form g are: range(2 * len(g) + 1).
  Greater indicies will append wrap the nothing at the end of the form.

  If you wrap (0, 1, 2) with the following indicies you get these
  resultant forms:

    0 -> (((),), 0, 1, 2)
    1 -> (((0,),), 1, 2)
    2 -> (0, ((),), 1, 2)
    3 -> (0, ((1,),), 2)
    4 -> (0, 1, ((),), 2)
    5 -> (0, 1, ((2,),))
    6 -> (0, 1, 2, ((),))

@deep
def unwrap(form, i):
  '''

  ((*)) -> *

  Unwrap an inner form (including nothing) in form at index i.

  (Unlike the wrap() function which handles indices specially to permit
  one function to wrap both "present" forms and intersticial nothing,
  unwrap() uses just the normal index.
