The "Word of God" is fractally encoded into the structure of structure at the most intrinsic and essential level.  Every tiniest least distinction made inherently contains or predicts or necessitates the entirety of everything you experience and have experienced and will experience, as well as the experiences of all other sentient beings everywhere throughout time.</p><div align="center">- = &#9678; = -</div><p>Observe an empty expanse.  For concreteness take the area below this sentence as a small space of the nondistinct Void.  (O Beloved Reader if you are without the visual sense the following can all be done in sound as well.)</p><blockquote><br><br><br></blockquote><p>There, that was a little bit of the Void, without distinction.</p><p>Now consider this mark:</p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>That mark can be said to be "one thing", yes?</p><p>But a moment's reflection will let us understand there are three "things there":</p><ol><li>The inside of the mark.</li><li>The outside of the mark.</li><li>The distinction, the boundary, between inside and outside.</li></ol><div align="center">- = &#9678; = -</div><p>Having made any distinction the Universe is partitioned into two "spaces" and the boundary between them. We can naturally represent this situation with a closed figure such as a circle:</p><blockquote><p>&#9675;</p></blockquote><p>But having done this to illustrate the triune nature of any distinction we can reflect again that this figure &#9675; has five parts: the inside and outside, the "inside" of the boundary, and the two boundaries separating the "inside" of the boundary from the outside-outside and the inside-outside.</p><p>This is a completely natural process.  Consider your location on the Earth.  The great majority of your life takes place on just such a boundary between the lava inward and the hard vacuum outward, and again on the boundary between the frozen-stone crust and the vaporous atmosphere.  If you stoop and examine conditions very close to this boundary you will discover additional boundaries to the limits of your perceptual apparatus.</p><p>This is a general phenomenon: the closer a sensory apparatus approaches in scale to a boundary, the more meta-boundaries it will resolve, up to its limits.</p><div align="center">- = &#9678; = -</div><p>Make a distinction,</p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice that it partitions the Universe into the mark and the unmarked.</p><blockquote><p>&#9675;</p></blockquote><p>We can imagine taking a perceptual position within the boundary itself and looking "outward" both to the distinct "inside-outside" and the "outside-outside" and perceiving "two things".  We can say that the Sky is around the Earth:</p><blockquote><p>&#9678;</p></blockquote><p>Or we can say that the Earth and the Sky are "two different things":</p><blockquote><p>&#9675;&#9675;</p></blockquote><p>Either way, the boundary is the perceptual illusion that we name "the horizon".  A moment's reflection lets us understand that "the horizon" is not real except as "it" is perceived.  Continuing in this way, we discover that there "are" many "things" that only exist because we perceive and name them.  Continuing in this way, we discover that all "things" only exist because we perceive and name them.  If we neglect to distinguish and name "things" there is "no-thing" there.</p><p>A man named George Spencer-Brown developed a wonderful notation and wrote it in a book he called "Laws of Form".  That is where I first encountered it, from a reference in the Whole Earth Catalog.</p><p>If you are interested in the "mystical" aspects of this notation I urge you to read the Tao Te Ching (I recommend highly the translation by J. Star) and GSB's "Laws of Form".  The experiences of Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor are also of direct relevance.  A neuroanatomist who suffered a stroke, she was able to understand what was happening to her as the symbolic processing areas of her brain were impaired by the flooding blood.  During the time that her symbolic processing systems were mechanically disengaged, Dr. Taylor reports transcendent bliss and the non-ability to differentiate between "her" body and the "external" Universe of phenomenon.</p><p>No more will be said here about the transcendental function of the notation.</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h1 align="center">"Formal Nonsense"</h1><p>For our purposes it will suffice to understand the following rule:</p><blockquote>A "mark" is a circle that is empty or contains no marks.</blockquote><p>You may find it worthwhile to play with some circles and use the rule to determine if the resulting forms count as "marks" or not.  For example these forms (taking paired parentheses to indicate closed circles) are "marks":</p><blockquote>&#9675;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(&#9678;)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#9675;&#9675;</blockquote><p>While these forms are not "marks" (or "not-marks"):</p><blockquote>&#9678;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(&#9675;&#9675;)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(&#9678;&#9675;)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;((&#9678;))</blockquote><p>Bricken has shown that two rules for "rewriting" or "transforming" these forms permit all possible forms to be generated or elucidated without altering the "mark"-ness of the resulting new forms.</p><p>These are the two rules (the Bricken basis):</p><blockquote>&#9675; &#8596; &#9675;&#9675;<br>nothing &#8596; &#9678;</blockquote><p>These rules can be described in language in many ways. We can say that any mark is the same as any number of marks, and that the Void is the same as a non-mark.  Using the rules from left-to-right (in the above depiction) generates new forms, and using them right-to-left reduces forms back to either a mark or the Void.</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">In the Land of Nomy</h3><blockquote>Know names to find the Ten Thousand Things.<br>No names am the Way<cite><br>~the Old Man</cite></blockquote><p>Once we can generate myriad forms we can perform another trick that is somewhat mysterious and somewhat concrete (like the primal distinction.)  The name of this trick is "naming", and it is, in a sense, the opposite of Void.</p><p>The initial distinction can be considered a name for itself.  By existing (which it only does because you made it) the distinction distinguishes something from the Void, and as there is no other thing to name, it names itself.</p><p>The Void is unknowable, inexpressible, but every distinction is a self-creating "name".</p><p>Then we do something really special, we "let" one bit of the plenum over here "name" some other bit of the plenum over there.</p><p>One pattern of distinctions (which we can think about concretely using the circle language) can "stand for" another pattern. This is an arbitrary and meaningless thing to do, but once made such a linkage is more-or-less mechanical.</p><p>We can write dictionaries and train dogs to salivate at the sound of a certain bell.  (This later sort of naming is just at the inflection point between analog and digital computation, the dog "knows" a word but it could never give you a symbolic definition of it.  However, if you were somehow to "mention" the bell-sound in a way the dog could re-cognize, perhaps by beginning a motion identical to the motion you make to ring the bell but doing it in the absence of the actual bell, the dog would salivate.  Put another way, you can tell if the dog "thinks" you are "talking about" dinner-time by whether or not it salivates.)</p><p>Our own brains are constantly attempting to move pattern-handling from costly "thought" to cheaper pattern-recognition.  We are always coming up with "names" for new parts of the plenum as we understand their relevance and utility for "our lives".</p><p>Despite the occasional problems with this approach it has proven so useful (for certain kinds of "useful") that we have built machines to do it for us, faster and with greater range than our nervous systems can handle.  Computers are collections of "names" for automatic pattern manipulation, along with means for recombining the names to form new names to recognize and manipulate new patterns.</p><p>We call these names "programs" and the art and science of writing new names out of the old is called "computer programming".</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">Naming Order, Ordering Names</h3><p>There are two ways of making names out of the circle language, and both are "cheating".</p><p>First, we can simply arrange patterns of circles to represent distinct symbols that we then "let stand for" other patterns.  This is how most kinds of printers actually work.  An "ink-jet" printer, for example, is precisely placing tiny circles of ink on the paper to make patterns that our nervous systems recognize.  A "dot-matrix" printer is just putting dots in a matrix.</p><p>The other way of naming patterns is to come up with some "ordering" convention for patterns, and then use those "numbers" to "index" any other sequence of patterns.</p><p>To make this concrete let's look at some possible orderings (let the underscore serve as an indicator of the Void.)  Here's one:</p><blockquote>_<br>&#9675;<br>&#9675;&#9675;<br>&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;<br>&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;</blockquote><p>That's pretty simple. Here's another:</p><blockquote>_<br>&#9675;<br>&#9678;<br>(&#9678;)<br>((&#9678;))</blockquote><p>Also pretty straightforward.  How about:</p><blockquote>_<br>&#9675;<br>&#9678;<br>&#9678;&#9675;<br>&#9675;&#9678;</blockquote><p>But there's a problem with those last two patterns: they are actually the same pattern.  Circles "don't care" about the order of stuff. How could they when we haven't even finished figuring out what "order" even means yet?</p><blockquote>_<br>&#9675;<br>&#9678;&#9675;<br>(&#9678;&#9675;) &#9678;&#9675;<br>((&#9678;&#9675;)&#9678;&#9675; ) (&#9678;&#9675;)&#9678;&#9675;</blockquote><p>It is a little difficult to see but the rule is anything gets replaced by a copy of itself inside a circle next to a copy of itself outside the circle.  This is a little unwieldy but it does generate patterns that don't repeat and are always unique.  But it's hardly the only way to go about it.</p><p>In a sense we are using these patterns as names for numbers, but in another sense numbers are just names for patterns that follow simple rules.  And, if we decided to "let" one of these sequences of patterns "stand for" an ordering, we are really just using the sequence as a kind of name aren't we?  But what are we naming with our sequence? Order?  But isn't the word "order" just a name for using a sequence as a name for "order"?  Where does this "order" really come from?</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">Surreal Numbers</h3><div align="center">- = &#9678; = -</div><p>Conway was thinking about the game Go and found numbers. He told Knuth about them and Knuth went on vacation for a week and wrote a love story. Knuth said, "Call them Surreal Numbers." and Conway agreed, so that's what they're called.</p><p>True story!</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">Naming Unknown</h3><p>For now, we will choose the first method in most of what follows and say that a letter, such as 'a', may be the name of some other pattern of circles.  "Just because."</p><p>(But really we know that the "letter" 'a' is just a bunch of little tiny circles jammed together in a squiggle with certain properties.  Later on we'll figure out how to talk about those properties properly but for now, "Just Because!")</p><p>But here's the really weird, the really bizarre and unreasonable thing we proceed to do next: we don't say what pattern of circles the name is a name for yet.</p><p>Now, whether you realize it or not, we're so used to doing this weird trick so automatically that we tend to forget just how mind-bendingly bizarre and unusual it is.</p><p>It's one thing to say a mark "names itself" because that's not really saying anything at all, at all, is it? If you say that the mark is saying itself, have you said anything?  And, if you weren't there saying that would the mark still be "a name"?  What kind of a question is that, anyway?</p><p>To say that a bit of pattern can "stand for" some other bit of pattern is, in comparison, quite reasonable.  "Smoke" means "fire" after all, doesn't it?</p><p>But when my friend says to me, "I have a friend, and I can't tell you his name, but..." don't I tend to know that there is a friend of my friend? But don't I tend to suspect that this friend's friend could be my friend, really? But maybe he is just making this up. After all, I'm just making him up.</p><p>So let's say that my friend's friend once told my friend, or so my friend informs me, that the squiggly line 'a' "is a name for" some pattern of circles, but I never found out which pattern of circles it was.</p><p>I know that every pattern of circles can reduce down to either the Void or a mark so I know this pattern "named" by 'a' must reduce down to one of those as well.</p><p>Consider this form:</p><blockquote>(a(a))</blockquote><p>Even though I don't know what pattern of circles 'a' is a name for, I can still tell that this pattern of circles is Void-valued.  The easy way to think about a simple pattern like this one is to just imagine replacing 'a' wherever it appears with one of the two values (Void and Something Else) and then checking the result.</p><p>If 'a' is nothing at all then:</p><blockquote><p>&#9678;</p></blockquote><p>Which is Void-valued.  And if 'a' is a mark:</p><blockquote><p>(&#9675;&#9678;)</p></blockquote><p>Which is also Void-valued. So, no matter what 'a' might be (a(a)) is Void-valued.</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">The Guardians</h3><p>You have been captured by an evil wizard and imprisoned in a room.

In the lambda calculus each lambda term is both a value and [the name for] an action to take on some values to derive or generate new values, which can themselves be lambda terms.  Likewise, in the SKI combinator calculus the combinators are both values and names of actions to take.  In computer programming, all programs are stored as sequences of bits, which are values.

  </pre></code><p>This is a direct "translation" of the sentence. "A mark is circle that is empty or has no marks in it."  In Python the empty tuple is considered to have the Boolean value of False so we invert that value.  If the tuple/form has contents then we recursively examine them to determine if any of them are marks.

  </pre></code><p>As you can verify for yourself, the expressions do indeed generate the expected values for their logical functions.</p><p>A standard XOR gate built out of NOR gates might look like this if it were to be translated directly into Circle Expressions:</p><code><pre>
    ((a(ab))((ab)b))

  </pre></code><p>But we have the expression:</p><code><pre>
    (((a)(b))(ab))

  </pre></code><p>We can use the logical methods described so admirably well on the Markable Mark web site to prove that the two expressions will always evaluate to the same results no matter the particular values of the 'a' and 'b' sub-expressions.</p><code><pre>
    ((a(ab))((ab)b)) = (((a)(b))(ab)) # Ugh, double check that this ain't inverted! TODO

  </pre></code><p>This is a somewhat more sophisticated approach than the simple term factoring discussed below.  It is also worth noting, again, that it is possible to generate new forms of equivalent value mechanically using existing art and it is possible to evaluate the expected performance of extensionally identical expressions as instantiated into specific physical (or software-on-existing-hardware) forms according to preferred utility metrics mechanically.  (again, cf. G&#246;del Machines.)</p></div><hr><div class="prose"><h3 align="center">More Circuits</h3><p>If we want to choose one of four options given a two-bit binary number we can make use of these expressions (where 'a' and 'b' are the bits and "endianness" is irrelevant):</p><code><pre>
    Two-Binary-Digits-to-One-of-Four-Selector:
    (ab) (a(b)) ((a)b) ((a)(b))

  </pre></code><p>For each pair of possible combinations of two binary signals only one of the above expressions will evaluate to True and the others will evaluate to False.</p><p>If we label the "inputs" 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' and permit only one at a time to be True, we can compose these expressions that will evaluate to the binary digits that encode our selection:</p><code><pre>
    One-of-Four-to-Two-Binary-Digits:
    ((ab)) ((ac))

  </pre></code><p>Note that 'd' is ignored.  Selecting option 'd' is the same as selecting no option: 'd' "is" zero. The first expression gives the most-significant-bit while the second give the least-significant-bit.</p><p>It is trivial to construct a circle expression that denotes a "Half-Bit Adder" circuit and proves its function. A circuit that will sum two binary inputs and output the sum and a "carry" or overflow signal can be represented by the following circle expressions (taking 'a' and 'b' as the binary digits to add together):</p><code><pre>
    Half-Bit Adder:
    Sum: (((a)(b))(ab))
    Carry: ((a)(b))

  </pre></code><p>As you can plainly see, the sum is given by XORing the inputs while the carry signal is just logical AND of the inputs.  In Python:</p><code><pre>
    half_bit_adder = xor(a, b), and_(a, b)

  </pre></code><p>But notice that both expressions contain the common sub-expression '((a)(b))'?  In fact, the "carry" expression is a sub-expression of the "sum".  We can reflect that in the Python code to generate the expression:</p><code><pre>
    def HBA(a, b):
      carry = and_(a, b)
      return carry, nor(carry, nor(a, b))

  </pre></code><p>This function captures (and parameterizes) the creation of a Half-Bit Adder circuit, refactoring it from the first expression but creating an identical result.</p><p>While it can be fun to perform these sorts of manipulations manually it should be obvious that they are highly susceptible to automated treatment.  There is no need to refactor the expressions at the level of Python source code, I am only doing that to illustrate the process concretely.  We explore below means of manipulating the circle expressions (as Python data structures) directly using logical unification algorithms.</p><p>In order to have richer expressions across which to reason and extend the reach of our notation we can compose expressions to generate new expressions that capture the behaviour of the composition of logic circuits.</p><p>For example, in order to build a general adder circuit that can be ganged together with copies of itself to add "wider" binary numbers we must arrange to take into account a 'Cin' signal to "carry in" the carry signal from an optional previous adder circuit.  Taking a standard circuit from the existing literature we have:</p><code><pre>
    Full-Bit Adder:
    Sum: ((((((a)(b))(ab)))(Cin))((((a)(b))(ab))Cin))
    Carry: (((((((a)(b))(ab)))(Cin))((a)(b))))

  </pre></code><p>And here is the resulting Truth-Table, as generated by reducing the above expressions after substituting the input values for their symbols:</p><code><pre>
     a  b Cin  Sum Cout
     0  0  0  -&gt; 0 0
     0  0  1  -&gt; 1 0
     0  1  0  -&gt; 1 0
     0  1  1  -&gt; 0 1
     1  0  0  -&gt; 1 0
     1  0  1  -&gt; 0 1
     1  1  0  -&gt; 0 1
     1  1  1  -&gt; 1 1

  </pre></code><p>The expressions give the desired output behaviour.</p><p>The Python code to generate the Full Bit Adder is straightforward:</p><code><pre>
    def FBA(a, b, Cin):
      k = xor(a, b)
      return xor(k, Cin), or_(and_(k, Cin), and_(a, b))

  </pre></code><p>And again, we can refactor the expressions "manually" in the Python code just by noticing and "pulling out" sub-expressions into formal calls to the generating functions (all of which are defined in terms of the nor() operation anyway. We are just drawing circles around circles.)</p><code><pre>
    def FBA(a, b, Cin):
      h = and_(a, b)
      y = nor(h, nor(a, b))
      j = and_(y, Cin)
      return nor(j, nor(y, Cin)), or_(j, h)

  </pre></code><p>I should note that I originally performed this factoring by simple string replacement on the original expressions (as a string, as they appear above) substituting new string symbols for the terms I wished to factor by means of calls to the replace() method of the expression string.  This works fine but there are better methods which are discussed below.</p><p>Again, even though the resulting expressions from each form of the FBA() function are identical, the circuits represented are not.</p><p>Logically they are both composed of the same arrangement of NOR gates but if you were to construct each of the above circuits using discrete IC components that matched the operations that appear in the functions the resulting circuits would calculate the same results but with variations in, say, power consumption, speed and other factors (but one would expect the variations to be small depending on the components chosen as modern hardware is quite efficient.)</p><p>Once we have the expressions for a Full-Bit Adder circuit that can be composed with copies of itself to create "wider" adders doing so is easy:</p><code><pre>
    Sum0, Cout0 = FBA(a0, b0, Cin)
    Sum1, Cout1 = FBA(a1, b1, Cout0)

  </pre></code><p>This generates the following expressions (note that we don't care about Cout0 because it is just passed back in to the carry signal of the next stage.  The output expressions are three: two bits for the sum and one for the carry):</p><code><pre>
    Sum0: ((((((a0)(b0))(a0 b0)))(Cin))((((a0)(b0))(a0 b0))Cin))

    Sum1: ((((((a1)(b1))(a1 b1)))((((((((a0)(b0))(a0 b0)))(Cin))((a0)(b0))))))
      ((((a1)(b1))(a1 b1))(((((((a0)(b0))(a0 b0)))(Cin))((a0)(b0))))))

    Cout1: (((((((a1)(b1))(a1 b1)))((((((((a0)(b0))(a0 b0)))(Cin))((a0)(b0))))))((a1)(b1))))

  </pre></code><p>We can do things to these expressions to make them simpler, but first let's "run" them by trying different inputs and checking the values of the outputs.  I've done that and formatted the binary values in decimal to make it easier to read.  Note that the 'Cout1' signal indicates an "overflow" of the two bits and so counts as 4 for purposes of determining the output of the adder as a decimal number.</p><code><pre>
    a   b  Cin sum carry
    0 + 0 + 0 = 0 + 0
